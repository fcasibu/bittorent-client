# bittorent-client

Just learning by going through projects I'm interested about in [build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) 

[Guide here](https://allenkim67.github.io/programming/2016/05/04/how-to-make-your-own-bittorrent-client.html). I can't seem to make bencode libraries work so created one instead since it's more enjoyable that way.
